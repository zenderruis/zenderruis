## Hi, I'm Mark!

#### I'm originally from the UK, however, Iâ€™ve lived and worked in a number of European countries and even learned the languagesâ€“unsual for a Brit, I know, but I like to immerse myself in the culture! 

#### I'm an aspiring Data Scientist with a background in Physics research (PhD) and Web Development & Marketing

#### I'm currently retraining as a Data Scientist at Le Wagon, having been accepted for their Data Science & AI course
